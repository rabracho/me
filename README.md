# Mission

My ultimate goal, by creating this page, is to demonstrate the value and creativity I provide, in hopes that it cultivates an opportunity to work with a team of likeminded individuals. In my current line of work, I am limited in the maximum effort I can generate to drive change. Rudimentary tasks and poor management initiatives led me to seek out new opportunities for growth. But the ultimate growth opportunity I see is a new, more change-focused role with a team that is motivated and hungry for optimization.
